# Ansible Homelab

!!! warning
    This project is undergoing a fairly significant refactor. The documentation will probably lag behind a bit.

    Until this message is removed, some of the commands and setup instructions may no longer work.

I manage my homelab with Ansible. I've put together [a Github repository](https://github.com/redjax/Ansible) with the collections, roles, and playbooks I use to maintain configurations across my whole homelab.
