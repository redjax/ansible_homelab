# Ansible Homelab

I manage my homelab with Ansible. I've put together [a Github repository](https://github.com/redjax/ansible_homelab) with the collections, roles, and playbooks I use to maintain configurations across my whole homelab.

!!! warning

    This documentation site is a work in progress. I will remove this message once I feel enough of the repository has been documented.

    A lot of the configurations in this repository are highly specific to the environment I use, and may need to be modified or rewritten entirely if you want to use them in your environment. I will make no effort to support use cases outside of what I personally need for my own environment.
